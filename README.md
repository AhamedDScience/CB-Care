## Overview

**This project aimed to develop a comprehensive LLM-based Q&A system for an e-learning company, CodeBasics (website: codebasics.io), which offers data-related courses and bootcamps. It showcases advanced AI technologies integrated to enhance the learning experience, featuring a robust framework, efficient data handling, and an intuitive user interface.**

# Components

## Large Language Model (LLM)

+ Model: Google Gemini LLM
+ Function: Provides a robust Q&A system, enabling students to get instant answers to their questions through voice conversations.

## Framework
+ Langchain: Facilitates the seamless integration of various components, enhancing the overall functionality and efficiency of the system.

## FAQ Integration
+ Data Source: Real CSV file of FAQs currently employed by CodeBasics.
+ Function: Assists learners by aligning the system with the company's existing support framework.

## AI Assistance
+ Function: Developed an LLM-based Q&A assistant to reduce the workload of human staff, allowing students to get answers within seconds.

## Text Embeddings
+ Model: Huggingface Instructor embeddings
+ Function: Implements effective text embeddings to improve the accuracy of the responses.

## Vector Database
+ Tool: FAISS
+ Function: Utilized for storing and retrieving relevant information efficiently.

## User Interface
+ Tool: Tkinter
+ Function: Created an intuitive user interface, providing a seamless and interactive experience for students.

## Unique Data Handling Approach
+ Method: Integrated real-time Q&A interactions with existing support resources.
+ Purpose: Ensures that the system remains contextually aware and provides accurate, up-to-date information.
